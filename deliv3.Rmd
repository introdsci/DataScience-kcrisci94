//New source to use for phase 2
https://www.counties.org/data-and-research

## $\color{red}{\text{Introduction}}$ 
The main goal of deliverable 3 is to revise and improve upon deliverables 1 and 2. I will also discuss possible continuation studies, and how we can benefit from the models that were generatated from this study.

## $\color{red}{\text{Revising Phase 1}}$ 
//add comments to phase 1 code that has no comments

## $\color{red}{\text{Revising Phase 2}}$ 
//use alternate source for data that contains populations from counties before 2010.
//add comments to each section of code

## $\color{red}{\text{About Model and Limitations}}$
//start by explaining what our model pridicts, accuracy, etc.
//model has low ability to explain variation (possbily because of the large gap in population sizes)
//other variables come into play, such as environmental region, CA Clean Air Acts, etc

## $\color{red}{\text{Future Exploration}}$
//explain where this study could go in the future and what kind of impact it could have on society
